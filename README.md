# Treasure-Hunt

Here's a Python script for a simple game called **"Treasure Hunt"**. It generates a grid-based map where the player navigates to find treasure while avoiding traps.

### How it works:
1. **Grid Map:** The map is a 5x5 grid where treasures (`T`) and traps (`X`) are randomly placed but hidden from the player.
2. **Player Movement:** The player starts at the top-left corner (`P`). They move using `w/a/s/d` to go up, left, down, or right.
3. **Winning or Losing:** If the player lands on a treasure, they win. If they land on a trap, they lose.

You can expand this game with features like multiple treasures, levels, or power-ups.
